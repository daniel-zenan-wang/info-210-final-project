#Project Description

1. What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

  We will be working with crimes in Washington State of the year 2012. We got our data from the http://sac.ofm.wa.gov/ washington
  state statistical analysis center. Depending on our results we may extend the project to look at other states or nationwide.

2. Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.

  Our target audience is people who are interested in the peaceful transfers of power in our democracy. We want to find trends in the data
  of crimes in 2012 to see if we can find more protests when Romney lost his election to see if we can draw any conclusions about this
  election. On the big picture, we will be looking at crime in washington and draw conclusions.
  
3. What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

  -Were there any spikes in crimes following the 2012 election?
  -Where does the crime occur most, what could be possible reasons why?
  -Where is the safest place in Washington state?

#Technical Description

1. What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page or slideshow compiled with KnitR, etc.)?

  -We will be using the Shiny app to display our report.

2. How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

  This is a regular csv file.

3. What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

  We are looking to subset and filter the data according to state and city. We will then explore that dataset further, looking for trends in crime by examining variables for each instance.

4. What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

  So far, we anticipate using the libraries that we have learned in class, but we will be exploring other libraries that may prove to be beneficial to our project.
  
5. What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?

  We want to see if there is a significant difference in crime in the month of the election versus the months before and after.
  
6. What major challenges do you anticipate? 

  This will be our first project working together and applying our technical skills. I think it will be challenging learning shiny and 
  applying all the different things we learned to put together in a finished product.
